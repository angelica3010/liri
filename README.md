Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface (LIRI) is a command line node app that takes in parameters and sends back data. Currently, LIRI is accepting commands for Twitter, Spotify, and movie listings. 

An example for sending a commmand in terminal would be typing "node liri.js my-tweets," which would show the last 20 tweets and when they were created in the terminal. Currently, this app is utilizing @trinhangel's  Twitter feed.
